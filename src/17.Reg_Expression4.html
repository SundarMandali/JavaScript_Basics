            function regex(){
                 
                var email=document.getElementById("email");
                /*
                Things to remember:
              1).  Eg)  var regx= /a.b/ ==> here dot is wild card character which means that anything between a and b letter is acceptable
                ==> so if we want to include dot as a letter in pattern then we can write as follows
                  var regx= /a\.b/ ==>  '\.' is used to represent this .Now the pattern is 'a.b'
             2). If we want any character set to be exceptional i.e optional then we should place '?' after that character set
                 Eg) in above email validation format 4th part is optional so we can use '?' after that pattern
            

                var regx= /^([a-z A-Z 0-9 \. -])@([a-z A-Z 0-9 -]).([a-z])(.[a-z])$/

                the above reg expression accepts only {1 character before @ ; 1 character before dot(.) ; also same for other two parts
                    so the each part can be restricted as below
            1st part is username it can be any length so we use "+" after the 1st character set which means 1 character or more than one
            2nd part is domain which is generally of any length and so we put '+' after 2nd character set
            3rd part is extension which is also in range of 2 to 8 and (this is not standard range) we put {2,8} after 3rd character set
        and same for 4th part

             var regx= /^([a-z A-Z 0-9 \. -]+)@([a-z A-Z -]+).([a-z]{2,8})(.[a-z]{2,8})?$/

             if(regx.test(email.value))
             {
                 alert("Valid email");
             }
             else
             alert("InValid email");
